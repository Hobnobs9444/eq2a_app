# eq2a_app

ARCP Logbook summaries generated from lifelong learning platform logbook download in .xlsx format. 
Currently focussed on the summaries required for EQ2a. Not pretty but it works. 
Mostly an exercise to teach me R. 
Needs updating once I get my head around R functions and package structure.
